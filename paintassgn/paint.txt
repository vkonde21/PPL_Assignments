"PhotoImage()" function returns the image object.
To display image in Python is as simple as that. But, the problem is PhotoImage class only supports GIF and PGM/PPM formats.
 
The more generalized formats are JPEG/JPG and PNG. To open and display with those formats, we need help of ImageTk and Image classes from PIL(photo imaging Library) package.
 
With the help of PIL(photo imaging Library), we can load images in over 30 formats and convert them to image objects, even base64-encoded GIF files from strings!!
Image class has an attribute "open()" which would open the not-so-directly-supported image formats and along with "ImageTk.PhotoImage()", we can return the image object and use it.
