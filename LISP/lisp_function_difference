prin1 object & optional output-stream

print object & optional output-stream

pprint object & optional output-stream

princ object & optional output-stream

    prin1 returns the object as its value.

    print prints the object with a preceding newline and followed by a space. It returns object.

    pprint is just like print except that the trailing space is omitted.

    princ is just like prin1 except that the output has no escape character
